This SpaceClaim script was created to fulfill the thesis requirements of Keith Sequeira (MSc Computational Fluid Dynamics, IRP - 2024), titled "Establishing Best Practices for Modelling Jet Blast"

Assistance
This script was developed with assistance from ChatGPT and Bing AI.

Script Files
The following Python scripts for SpaceClaim are included:

1. SingleJet_Model_Meters.py 
   Models a cylindrical domain in meters for a single jet and assigns all named selections. Adjust dimensions of the cylinder and domain as per requirements.

2. SingleJet_Model_Millimeters.py  
    Models a cylindrical domain in millimetres for a single jet and assigns all named selections. Adjust dimensions of the cylinder and domain as per requirements.

3. MultipleJet_Model_Meters.py 
   Models multiple cylinders and assigns all named selections, except for the inlet (cylinder outlet), which requires user input. Additionally, the user must specify dimensions for both the cylinders and the domain.

Usage Instructions
1. Open SpaceClaim and load the desired script.
2. Run Script
3. Review and adjust the model as necessary for your specific application.

Requirements
ANSYS SpaceClaim Software
